# Machine Learning for Investing

## Investing for everyone

### Lower barrier of entry

For the last few years, the financial investment market has been more open. The entry barrier is lower as fresh, agile players entering the financial market and competing with traditional financial institution by providing easy to use trading experience and above all, no more transaction fee. Robinhood is one of the pioneers - it doesn't charge any trading fee and constantly enhances the user experience in their apps. Recently closed a round of $280M series F, Robinhood is valuated at $8.3B. Such competition forces traditional players, such as TD Ameritrade, to follow suits and waive fee for their users.

This has a huge impact to lower the barrier for people who has spare money and wanted to invest. Not everyone has thousands or millions of dollars available for trading/investing. If you have just a few hundreds of dollars, it doesn't justify to open a trading account (this used to has a fee) and pay for transaction fee and commission (if you are using a brokerage account)

Also, some financial institutions such as M1 Finance allow you to purchase fractional share, which is a fraction equity of a share. This makes some big stocks such as Amazon (2.460,60 per share at the time of writing) much more accessible, and thus, provide more opportunities to diversify one's porfolio.

### Why machine learning?

It takes time to build a sustainable trading strategy. It even take more time to achieve the knowledge enough to research different trading strategies and choose one that suits one's budget (how much money do you have?), investing horizon time (how long that you can keep the trading budget untouched until you need to spend it?), and risk apetite (how much you are willing to lose/temporary lose?).

In an ideal world, an algorithm would take the aforementioned paramenters (budget, timeline, and risk) to develop a trading algorithm with a reasonable and sustainable return. This calls for machine learning to search, build, and backtest a trading strategy that suitable for each trader's profile.
